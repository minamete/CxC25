    "# Exploratory Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Structure Overview\n",
    "These are the topics that we have in the dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Economic Policy & Debt\n",
    "1. Economic Policy & Debt: External debt: Debt ratios & other items \n",
    "    - Multilateral debt service (% of public and publicly guaranteed debt service)     _(depends on income type)_    \n",
    "2. Economic Policy & Debt: National accounts: Adjusted savings & income\n",
    "    - Adjusted savings: education expenditure (current US$)        \n",
    "    - Adjusted net national income per capita (current US$)\n",
    "3. Economic Policy & Debt: National accounts: Local currency at constant prices: Other items\n",
    "    - Terms of trade adjustment (constant LCU)\n",
    "    \n",
    "A country that pays off a high amount of multilateral debt might indicate that it has a high multilateral debt: intranational debt (?) ratio, i.e. it has a lot of foreign stakeholders and not many domestic stakeholders. This could indicate that the country is not very economically developed.\n",
    "                \n",
    "A country that spends a lot of education may be developed to the point where it can do that. Expect a high correlation with high GNI.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjusted GNI can rule out resource-heavy countries. This could be a good \"main\" plurality indicator for economic health/wellbeing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Terms of trade adjustment could favour less globalized countries (expect lower GNI correlation), or it could favour countries that are self-sufficient or have more global soft power because of their resources. Maybe this would skew towards large & developing countries like Brazil?\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "It might be nice to model education efficiency on a % ratio of (participation * outcomes) to (participation, inputs), to see how economically efficient the education is. It could also be interesting to see if participation levels off.\n",
    "\n",

    "2. Environment: Density & urbanization\n",
    "    - Urban population (% of total population)\n",
    "\n",
